# 🌐 Essential Networking Protocols and Ports for DevOps Engineers
Networking for DevOps (edit from Remote)

In DevOps Networking knowledge is essential for deploying micro services, automation infrastructure or monitoring system, understanding protocol's and port is help you to troubleshoot issue, configure firewall and secure your system.

## **Application Layer Protocol**


These protocols is used to operate with Apllication layer(Layer-7) and are used by services and tool you intract with daily.

1. **HTTP**(Hypertext transfer Protocol), **Port**- 80, standard web commmunication protocol and used in Web Server.
2. **HTTPS**(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), **Port**- 443, Secure HTTP using SSL/TLS(Secure Sockets layer/ Transport layer Sercurity)
3. **FTP**(File Transfer protocol), **Port**- 21, Transfer file between Client and Server.
4. **SFTP/SCP**(Secure FTP/ Secure Copy protocol), **Port**- 22, Secure file transfer over SSH
5. **SSH**(Secure Shell), **Port**- 22, Secure Shell for remote access and Automation.
6. **DNS**(Domain Name System), **Port**- 53, Resolve domain names to IP addresses.
7. **SMTP**(Secure MAil transfer Protocol), **Port**- 25/587/465, Sends Email Notifications
8. **SNMP**(Simple Network Managemnt Protocol), **Port**- 161, Monitors and manage network devices.
9. **NTP**(Network Time Protocol), **Port**- 123, Synchronizes time across systems.

## **Transport Layer Protocol**

1. **TCP**(Transmission control protocol), **Port**- , reliable and connection-oriented data delivery.
2. **UDP**(User Datagram Protocol), **Port**- , fast andd connectionless data transfer.

## **Internet and Networking Protocol**

1. **DHCP**(Dynamics Host Configuration Protocol),  **Port**- 67/68, Assigns IP address dynamically.
2. **ARP**(Address Resolutions Protocol),  **Port**- , Maps IP to MAC address on local network.
3. **DoH(DNS Over HTTPS)**,  **Port**- 443, Encrypt DNS lookups, improve privacy and security in cloud applications.

## **DevOps Tool-Specific ports**

1. **Jenkins**  **Port**- 8080
2. **Docker Registry**  **Port**- 5000
3. **Kubernetes API Server** **Port**- 6443
4. **Prometheus**  **Port**- 9090
5. **Prometheus**  **Port**- 9090
6. **Grafana**  **Port**- 3000
7. **Elasticsearch**  **Port**- 9200
8. **Kibana**  **Port**- 5601
9. **GitLab runner/CI**  **Port**- 8081/443

Networking is the **Foundation of All DevOps practices.** Knowing these Protocol and their Ports empowers you to:-
1. Secure your environment
2. Debbug network issue
3. Automate deployment
4. Build reliable cloud-native system
