# Day 19 – Shell Scripting Project: Log Rotation, Backup & Crontab
## Task 1: Log Rotation Script

This script ensures your disk doesn't fill up with stale logs. It targets logs older than a 5 Days.

[script: log_rotate.sh](scripts/log_rotate.sh)

```
-c   → create a new archive
-z   → compress using gzip
-f   → specify the filename of the archive
```

## Task 2. Server Backup Script (backup.sh)

Standardized backups are vital. This script uses tar for archiving and includes a cleanup mechanism for backups older than 14 Days.

## Task 4. Maintenance Script

The maintenance.sh combines both functions with logging.

## Key Learnings

- Exit Codes Matter: Using exit 1 on errors prevents a script from continuing blindly and potentially deleting the wrong files.

- The find Command is King: The ability to filter by time (-mtime) and execute actions (-exec) makes it the most powerful tool for cleanup tasks.

- Error Handling is Crucial: Always check if directories exist before operating on them, verify backup integrity after creation, and provide meaningful error messages. This makes scripts production-ready and prevents data loss.
